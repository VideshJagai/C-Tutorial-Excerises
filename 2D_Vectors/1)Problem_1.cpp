/*
     In C++, Vector are called dynamic arrays that can automatically resize themseleves
     when an items is inserted or removed, with its storage being controlled automatically
     by the container.
     
     A 2-Dimensional Vector,  also known as vector of vectors, is vector with an adjustable
     number of rows where each of the rows is a vector. 
     
     Here, each vector index stores a vector that can be traversed and accessed with 
     assitance of iterator.
     
     Syntax:
        vector<vector<data_type>> v;
        
                                        How 2D Vector works in C++?
        
        Syntax of a two-dimensional vector. 
        
     vector<vector<int> > vtr{{34,55,43,13},{45,61,15,89},{53,62,17,12}
     
     Hence, a vector vtr is intialised with the three rows and four columns. 
     
     The vector appearance itself, we can know that it is similar to matrices.
     
     Applications of the 2-D vector include:
     i) Image reprsentation and manipulation
     ii) Reprsentation of 2-D grid.
     iii) Applications in dynamic programming..
